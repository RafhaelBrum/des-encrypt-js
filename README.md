# DES Encryption

This project implements the DES (Data Encryption Standard) algorithm in JavaScript. The code was developed following a step-by-step tutorial available at [simewu.com](https://simewu.com/des/).

## Description

DES is a symmetric encryption algorithm that uses a 56-bit key to encrypt data. This project contains the complete implementation of the algorithm in a single file.

## How to Use

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/RafhaelBrum/des-encrypt-js.git
   cd des-encrypt-js
   ```

2. **Run the code:**
   Ensure you have a JavaScript environment set up (like Node.js). You can run the file directly:
   ```bash
   node des.js
   ```
   Note: The default values in the code for the key and message are '0123456789ABCDEF'. You can change them to different values in step 0 of the code.
